I agree with your suggestion. A web application would be the most suitable modality for this task as it allows us to scrape social media platforms, analyze the research, and present the findings in a user-friendly interface. It also provides the flexibility for users to access the application from any device with an internet connection.

Please note that in the scraper.py file, you need to replace the placeholder code with your actual implementation for scraping scientists from social media, retrieving research information, analyzing research for commercial potential, and saving leads in the venture capital firm's database. Additionally, you may need to modify the URLs and HTML parsing logic based on the structure of the target websites.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `get_scientists` and `get_research` methods in the `Scraper` class are not implemented correctly. The current implementation assumes that the scientists and research information can be scraped from a website using the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup`. However, the URLs and HTML structure used in the code are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target social media platforms and university websites.

<Suggestion>
To fix this issue, you need to:
1. Identify the social media platforms used by the scientists and the websites of the Danish universities.
2. Research the APIs or scraping techniques required to extract the scientists' information and their research from these platforms and websites.
3. Implement the `get_scientists` and `get_research` methods using the appropriate APIs or scraping techniques for each platform and website.
4. Update the code to use the actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target platforms and websites.

Please note that scraping social media platforms may require authentication or API keys, so make sure to handle any necessary authentication or API key management in your implementation.

Once you have implemented the correct scraping logic, the rest of the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
The highest priority comment is that the `get_scientists` and `get_research` methods in the `Scraper` class are not implemented correctly. The current implementation assumes that the scientists and research information can be scraped from a website using the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup`. However, the URLs and HTML structure used in the code are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target social media platforms and university websites.

To fix this issue, you need to:
1. Identify the social media platforms used by the scientists and the websites of the Danish universities.
2. Research the APIs or scraping techniques required to extract the scientists' information and their research from these platforms and websites.
3. Implement the `get_scientists` and `get_research` methods using the appropriate APIs or scraping techniques for each platform and website.
4. Update the code to use the actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target platforms and websites.

Please note that scraping social media platforms may require authentication or API keys, so make sure to handle any necessary authentication or API key management in your implementation.

Once you have implemented the correct scraping logic, the rest of the code should work as expected.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix.

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the implementation of the `get_scientists` method in the `Scraper` class. Currently, it is scraping scientists' names from a website using a hardcoded URL. However, the URL is not dynamic and does not change based on the university parameter passed to the method. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_scientists` method to dynamically generate the URL based on the university parameter. We can use string formatting to insert the university name into the URL. Here's the revised code for the `get_scientists` method:

```python
def get_scientists(self, university):
    scientists = []
    url = f"https://example.com/{university}/scientists"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
        scientist_elements = soup.find_all("div", class_="scientist")
        for scientist_element in scientist_elements:
            scientist_name = scientist_element.find("h2").text
            scientists.append(scientist_name)
    return scientists
```

Please update the `get_scientists` method in the `scraper.py` file with the revised code.

The current implementation assumes that the scientists and research information can be scraped from a website using the requests library and BeautifulSoup. However, the URLs and HTML structure used in the code are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target social media platforms and university websites.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to:\n1. Identify the social media platforms used by the scientists and the websites of the Danish universities.\n2. Research the APIs or scraping techniques required to extract the scientists\' information and their research from these platforms and websites.\n3. Implement the get_scientists and get_research methods using the appropriate APIs or scraping techniques for each platform and website.\n4. Update the code to use the actual URLs and parsing logic specific to the target platforms and websites.\n\nPlease note that scraping social media platforms may require authentication or API keys, so make sure to handle any necessary authentication or API key management in your implementation.\n\nOnce you have implemented the correct scraping logic, the rest of the code should work as expected.', 'task': 'build a scraper that follows scientists on social media from all danish universities and indepth understand if their research has commercial potential for our venture capital firm.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the implementation of the `get_scientists` method in the `Scraper` class. Currently, it is scraping scientists' names from a website using a hardcoded URL. However, the URL is not dynamic and does not change based on the university parameter passed to the method. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_scientists` method to dynamically generate the URL based on the university parameter. We can use string formatting to insert the university name into the URL. Here's the revised code for the `get_scientists` method:

```python
def get_scientists(self, university):
    scientists = []
    url = f"https://example.com/{university}/scientists"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
        scientist_elements = soup.find_all("div", class_="scientist")
        for scientist_element in scientist_elements:
            scientist_name = scientist_element.find("h2").text
            scientists.append(scientist_name)
    return scientists
```

Please update the `get_scientists` method in the `scraper.py` file with the revised code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `tkinter` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the `main.py` and `scraper.py` files:

In `main.py`:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from scraper import Scraper
```

In `scraper.py`:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

[2023-11-09 15:04:09 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 <COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `tkinter` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the `main.py` and `scraper.py` files:

In `main.py`:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from scraper import Scraper
```

In `scraper.py`:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Also, make sure that the necessary libraries are installed in the environment where the code will be executed.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
